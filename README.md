## Description
- Two small python projects that I made for an interview at Accenture's software engineering team, as part of a presentation I had to do that they asked me to make.
- I was applying for their software engineering / development L6 Degree Apprenticeship at one of their UK locations.
- I didn't end up getting the role, but it's worth putting this on GitHub simply for future reference.
- I was told I didn't have to make any slides or resources but I thought this would impress them.
- In my perspective I think it went pretty well. ðŸ˜Š
- **These projects will not recieve any updates.**

### Project 1
- Graph + diagram generator using [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/), [Mermaid.js](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) and tkinter for GUI.
- Small scale Python remake of an app I previously made for my father privately.
- Original was in .NET + WinForms, which was impossible to run on a Mac.

### Project 2
- Just converts markdown into a powerpoint .pptx
- Simple really. Wasn't shown off much and was just to demonstrate how you could automate making powerpoints.

---
## Prerequisites
- Anthropic API key and requirements to use their service.
- [Mermaid.js CLI](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) installed and set up.
- [Pandoc for Python](https://github.com/boisgera/pandoc) installed and set up.

---
## Usage
- They're just python projects, I used PyCharm on my Macbook M2 to create these on a trainride.
- You can open the files in VSCode, IDLE, PyCharm, or any other similar text editor.
- Then for the first project only replace "123XYZ" with your API key. It should work!
