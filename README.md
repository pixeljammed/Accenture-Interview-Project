<marquee> I didn't get the job btw </marquee>

-----

Two small python projects that I made for an interview at Accenture's software engineering team, as part of a presentation I had to do that they asked me to make.
I was applying for their software engineering / development L6 Degree Apprenticeship at one of their UK locations.
I didn't end up getting the role, but it's worth putting this on GitHub simply for future reference.
I was told I didn't have to make any slides or resources but I thought this would impress them.
In my perspective I think it went pretty well. ðŸ˜Š
